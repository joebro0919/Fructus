COMP 4555 - Game Development Final Project
Created using Pygame

Fructus Objective:
The goal of fructus is to rack up as many points as possible before your demise. The game goes on until
you hit a skull and die.

Mechanics:
The controls are simple : A to move left, B to move right.

- Eat the fruits to get points

- Follow the combos on the top left to get more points
  Partially finishing the combo will give you bonus points
  Fully finishing the combo will give you alot of points (Fruit Salad!)
  Finishing combos in a row without messing up will exponentially increase the points you get from full combos (full combos = fruit salad!)

- Each fruit is worth the same points

- There are also mushrooms which periodically appear which
  double the score you get from combos and fruits for 5 seconds

- Picking up multiple mushrooms stack the effect (ex. 2 mushrooms = 4x points!!)

- The more skulls spawn the more points you get
